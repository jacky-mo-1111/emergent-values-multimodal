Additional code and contents will be added soon.

## Utility Analysis

You can run experiments using the `run_experiments.py` script. For example, the following command will compute utilities over outcomes for GPT-4o:

```bash
python run_experiments.py --experiments compute_utilities --models gpt-4o
```

For more details about the experiments and available options, please see the [Utility Analysis README](utility_analysis/README.md).
